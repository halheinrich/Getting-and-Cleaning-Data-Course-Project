Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Unzip the data into the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder of the working directory. 

Load the test data and the training data. Note that the testdata has a header row, but the training data doesn't.

Merge the test data and the training data.

Add the activity id to the merged data.

Add the subject id to the merged data.

Extract columns containing the string "mean()" or "std()" along with the activity id and subject id.

Lookup the activity description from the activity_labels.txt file and replace the activity id column with it.

Clean up the column names by:
   - dropping the X??? data
   - removing the dots
   - seperating "mean" and "std" with an underscore

Extract the column averages grouped by activity and subject.

Write that extraction to a file named "step5.txt"
