# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository is for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera by Johns Hopkins.
This repository corresponds to the course project.

The script that does the work is named run_analysis.R

It depends on the data found here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

This file should be unzipped into the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder of the working directory.

For more information, read the codeBook.txt file. Note that the code in run_analysis.R is commented and may be read along side the code book.
